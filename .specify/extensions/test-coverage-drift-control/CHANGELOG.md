# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-12

- Make report reruns incremental by preserving historical findings with stable `COV-DRIFT-###` identifiers and `Pending`/`Resolved` status
- Limit remediation planning and task generation to pending findings while preserving existing tasks
- Record evidence-based, behavior-preserving remediation plans in report findings before generating implementation tasks
- Add a final remediation task that marks only successfully remediated and validated findings as `Resolved` with resolution notes

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-31

- Remove source command metadata markers so installed opencode command wrappers do not duplicate extension/config comments

- Update the manifest metadata, repository links, and README for standalone publishing
- Preserve the existing report, remediation, and optional `after_implement` workflow
- Use stable `COV-DRIFT-###` identifiers, with the `COV-DRIFT-` prefix plus a numeric sequence, for test-coverage-drift-control reporting and remediation workflows

## [0.1.0]

- Add the initial beta Spec Kit extension
- Generate or refresh `test-coverage-drift-report.md` for the active feature implementation
